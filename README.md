# 🧠 AtliQ T-Shirts: AI-Integrated Database Q&A Engine

Welcome to **AtliQ T-Shirts**, a smart inventory and discount management system — supercharged with **AI-powered natural language querying**. This isn’t just a MySQL database — it’s a **conversational knowledge interface** built on structured data.

---

## 🚀 Overview

AtliQ T-Shirts is a full-stack data project where relational data meets intelligent interaction. It simulates a retail clothing company managing SKUs, stock levels, dynamic discounts, and real-time inventory — all accessible through **natural language AI queries**.

### 🎯 Core Objectives

- 🗃️ Design a clean, constraint-rich **MySQL schema** for inventory & discount logic.
- 🧠 Build an **AI layer** (e.g., via Gemini/OpenAI/GPT) that:
  - Understands human language queries
  - Translates them to SQL
  - Extracts, summarizes, or explains insights
- 🔍 Enable smart querying like:
  - “Which t-shirts have active discounts this week?”
  - “Show low-stock Adidas items in XL”
  - “What’s the average price after discounts for cotton shirts?”

|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Database             | MySQL with InnoDB                  |
| AI Engine            | Gemini / OpenAI GPT / LangChain    |
| Interface (Optional) | Python Flask / Node.js / Streamlit |
| Voice Layer (Optional) | gTTS / ElevenLabs / WebSpeech   |

## 🧩 Schema Design

### 👕 `t_shirts` Table
- Normalized data: brand, size, color using `ENUM`
- Strict constraints for pricing, stock, and types
- Auto-handled timestamps

### 🔖 `discounts` Table
- Linked via `t_shirt_id` (FK)
- Date-bound discount % (e.g., 10%, 20%)
- No boolean flags — discount *activeness* inferred via SQL

### 👁️‍🗨️ `t_shirt_inventory` View
- Live merge of shirt data + discounts
- Auto-calculates `discounted_price`

---

## 🧠 AI Integration

> “Your data shouldn’t wait for SQL. It should *speak*.”

This layer uses LLMs to convert **natural language** into **SQL queries** in real-time. For example:

### Example Interaction

- **User asks**:  
  `"How many Puma t-shirts are on sale?"`

- **AI-generated SQL**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM t_shirts t
  JOIN discounts d ON t.t_shirt_id = d.t_shirt_id
  WHERE t.brand = 'Puma' 
    AND CURRENT_DATE BETWEEN d.start_date AND d.end_date;
````

* **AI response**:
  `"There are 12 Puma t-shirts currently on discount."`

This empowers **non-technical users** to interact with data seamlessly.

## 📊 Sample Queries

| Natural Language Input          | SQL Translation                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Top 5 cheapest black t-shirts   | `ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 5`                   |
| Which sizes are out of stock?   | `WHERE stock_quantity = 0`                     |
| Show discounts ending this week | `WHERE end_date <= CURDATE() + INTERVAL 7 DAY` |

## 📈 Future Vision

* 🔮 Predictive pricing with ML
* 📦 Automated stock alerts & restocking
* 🛒 Integration with e-commerce dashboards
* 🗣️ Voice-to-query using speech recognition
